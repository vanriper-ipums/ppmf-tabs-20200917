Tabulations from the 2020-09-17 vintage Privacy Protected Microdata File

## Introduction
This repository contains code that converts the US Census Bureau's 2020-09-17 vintage Privacy Protected Microdata File (PPMF) [ADD LINK TO WEBSITE] into counts (_e.g._, total population) for geographic units. The counts are available through IPUMS NHGIS [ADD LINK TO WEBSITE].

The 2020-09-17 vintage PPMF supports the production of the six data tables that are included in the P.L. 94-171 dataset, which is used for legislative redistricting. The data tables are:

* Race [63 categories]
* Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino by Race
* Race [63 categories] for the Population 18 years and Over
* Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino by Race for the Population 18 years and Over
* Group Quarters Population by Group Quarters Type
* Occupancy Status 

The first five tables are based on person-level microdata records, and the last table is based on housing unit data.
